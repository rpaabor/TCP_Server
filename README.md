# TCP_Server and TCP client.

This is a example of TCP server and client.

There is some other features in the server like a login service, that is not implemented in current version.
I think i hawe done a couple of diffrent modifications to this solution, and the current one is for blockchain,
to verify that message chain is immutable.

usage.
I use VisualStudio and build application, start server just hit enter on settings.
Start client, u can start as many as u like hit enter when it promts for settings.
Try sending messages from clients, they will be added to the current blockchain so full history is avalible at all time.
