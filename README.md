# TCP_Server and TCP client.

This is a example of TCP server and client,
To use, start server and set it up, you dont have to set port and buffer.
Start Client, dont set ipadress local adress will be used.

In current configuration it uses Blockchain to verify that message que is immutable.
There is some other features in the server like a login service, that is not fully implemented.
This is not for production use, its only a example of how it can be done.
